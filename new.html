<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
The 30Kbps limit that Shannon’s Law imposes on analog telephone modems is a
formidable barrier to the promise of a boundless Internet world open to anyone
who can afford a computer. Although long-distance telephone links have been
fast and digital for decades, the local loop wires running from the telephone
switching center to the consumer continue to use hundred-year-old analog technology.
The “last mile” local loop can, in fact, span many miles, making it
extremely expensive to bring the analog telephone service of yesterday into the
digital world of the present.
Fortunately, the physical conductors in telephone wire are thick enough to support
moderate-speed digital traffic for several miles without severe attenuation. Recognizing
this, telecommunications groups have developed technologies to provide
inexpensive digital services for residences and small businesses. Digital Subscriber
Line (DSL) is one such technology that can coexist with plain old telephone service
(POTS) on the same wire pair that carries the digital traffic. At present, most DSL
services are available only to those customers whose premises connect with the central
telephone switching office (CO) using less than 18,000 feet (5460 m) of copper
cable. Of course, this is not the same thing as saying that a customer is within 18,000
feet of the CO, because the route taken by the service cable is rarely a straight line.
Traditional analog telephone service, POTS, terminates local loop service at a
frame, or switching center, at the CO. From the switching center, a dedicated circuit
is established through another switching center, perhaps onto a long-distance
trunk line, or perhaps directly out of the same switching center back into the same
local loop. All of this circuit switching takes place based on the analog characteristics
of the connection.
the tape measure from a huge tool storage chest, run down to the basement, measure
the wood, run back out to the garage, leave the tape measure, grab the saw,
and then return to the basement with the saw and cut the wood. Now you decide
to bolt some pieces of wood together. So you run to the garage, grab the drill set,
go back down to the basement, drill the holes to put the bolts through, go back to
the garage, leave the drill set, grab one wrench, go back to the basement, find out
the wrench is the wrong size, go back to the tool chest in the garage, grab another
wrench, run back downstairs . . . wait! Would you really work this way? No!
Being a reasonable person, you think to yourself “If I need one wrench, I will
probably need another one of a different size soon anyway, so why not just grab
the whole set of wrenches?” Taking this one step further, you reason “Once I am
done with one certain tool, there is a good chance I will need another soon, so
why not just pack up a small toolbox and take it to the basement?” This way, you
keep the tools you need close at hand, so access is faster. You have just cached
some tools for easy access and quick use! The tools you are less likely to use
remain stored in a location that is further away and requires more time to access.
This is all that cache memory does: It stores data that has been accessed and data
that might be accessed by the CPU in a faster, closer memory.
Another cache analogy is found in grocery shopping. You seldom, if ever, go
to the grocery store to buy one single item. You buy any items you require immediately
in addition to items you will most likely use in the future. The grocery
store is similar to main memory, and your home is the cache. As another example,
consider how many of us carry around an entire phone book. Most of us have a
small address book instead. We enter the names and numbers of people we tend
to call more frequently; looking a number up in our address book is much quicker
than finding a phone book, locating the name, and then getting the number. We
tend to have the address book close at hand, whereas the phone book is probably
located in our home, hidden in an end table or bookcase somewhere. The phone
book is something we do not use frequently, so we can afford to store it in a little
more out of the way location. Comparing the size of our address book to the telephone
book, we see that the address book “memory” is much smaller than that of
a telephone book. But the probability is very high that when we make a call, it is
to someone in our address book.
Students doing research offer another commonplace cache example. Suppose
you are writing a paper on quantum computing. Would you go to the library,
check out one book, return home, get the necessary information from that book,
go back to the library, check out another book, return home, and so on? No, you
would go to the library and check out all the books you might need and bring
them all home. The library is analogous to main memory, and your home is,
again, similar to cache.
And as a last example, consider how one of your authors uses her office. Any
materials she does not need (or has not used for a period of more than six months)
get filed away in a large set of filing cabinets. However, frequently used “data”
remain piled on her desk, close at hand, and easy (sometimes) to find. If she
needs something from a file, she more than likely pulls the entire file, not simply
one or two papers from the folder. The entire file is then added to the pile on her
Bill Gates had given a speech in High School about 11 rules/things they did not and will not learn in school. He talked about how feel-good, politically correct teachings created a generation of kids with no concept of reality and how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.

Rule 1

Life is not fair – get used to it!

Rule 2

The world won’t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.

Rule 3

You will NOT make $60,000 a year right out of high school. You won’t be a vice-president with a car phone until you earn both.

Rule 4

If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.

Rule 5

Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your Grandparents had a different word for burger flipping: they called it opportunity.

Rule 6

If you mess up, it’s not your parents’ fault, so don’t whine about your mistakes, learn from them.

Rule 7

Before you were born, your parents weren’t as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you thought you were. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parent’s generation, try delousing the closet in your own room.

Rule 8

Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life HAS NOT. In some schools, they have abolished failing grades and they’ll give you as MANY TIMES as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.

Rule 9

Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you FIND YOURSELF. Do that on your own time.

Rule 10

Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.

Rule 11

Be nice to nerds. Chances are you’ll end up working for one.
Islamic Republic of Pakistan (اسلامی جمہوریۂ پاکستان) is a very important country geographically and politically. 
One of the reasons for this importance is that some very important countries like Chine, Iran, India and Afghanistan etc surround Pakistan.Bill Gates came from a family of entrepreneurship and high-spirited liveliness. William Henry 
Gates III was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28th, 1955. His father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International.
Bill Gates – Early Life
He had an early interest in software and began programming computers at the age of thirteen. In 1973, Bill Gates became a student at Harvard University, where he meet Steve Ballmer (now Microsoft’s chief executive officer). While still a Harvard undergraduate, Bill Gates wrote a version of the programming language BASIC for the MITS Altair microcomputer.
Did you know that as young teenagers Bill Gates and Paul Allen ran a small company called Traf-O-Data and sold a computer to the city of Seattle that could count city traffic?

 Another reason is Pakistan being a nuclear power.

The world won’t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.

Rule 3

You will NOT make $60,000 a year right out of high school. You won’t be a vice-president with a car phone until you earn both.

Rule 4

If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.

Rule 5

Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your Grandparents had a different word for burger flipping: they called it opportunity.

Rule 6

If you mess up, it’s not your parents’ fault, so don’t whine about your mistakes, learn from them.

Rule 7

Before you were born, your parents weren’t as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you thought you were. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parent’s generation, try delousing the closet in your own room.

Rule 8

Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life HAS NOT. In some schools, they have abolished failing grades and they’ll give you as MANY TIMES as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.

Rule 9

Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you FIND YOURSELF. Do that on your own time.

Rule 10

Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.

Rule 11

Be nice to nerds. Chances are you’ll end up working for one.

Bill Gate’s company Microsoft became famous for their computer operating systems and killer business deals. For example, Bill Gates talked IBM into letting Microsoft retain the licensing rights to MS-DOS an operating system, that IBM needed for their new personal computer. Gates proceeded to make a fortune from the licensing of MS-DOS.
On November 10, 1983, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Microsoft Corporation formally announced Microsoft Windows, a next-generation operating system.

On his return from Europe, he gained his livelihood by the practice of law, but his fame came from his Persian- and Urdu-language poetry, which was written in the classical style for public recitation.
 Through poetic symposia and in a milieu in which memorizing verse was customary, his poetry became widely kn

the tape measure from a huge tool storage chest, run down to the basement, measure
the wood, run back out to the garage, leave the tape measure, grab the saw,
and then return to the basement with the saw and cut the wood. Now you decide
to bolt some pieces of wood together. So you run to the garage, grab the drill set,
go back down to the basement, drill the holes to put the bolts through, go back to
the garage, leave the drill set, grab one wrench, go back to the basement, find out
the wrench is the wrong size, go back to the tool chest in the garage, grab another
wrench, run back downstairs . . . wait! Would you really work this way? No!
Being a reasonable person, you think to yourself “If I need one wrench, I will
probably need another one of a different size soon anyway, so why not just grab
the whole set of wrenches?” Taking this one step further, you reason “Once I am
done with one certain tool, there is a good chance I will need another soon, so
why not just pack up a small toolbox and take it to the basement?” This way, you
keep the tools you need close at hand, so access is faster. You have just cached
some tools for easy access and quick use! The tools you are less likely to use
remain stored in a location that is further away and requires more time to access.
This is all that cache memory does: It stores data that has been accessed and data
that might be accessed by the CPU in a faster, closer memory.
Another cache analogy is found in grocery shopping. You seldom, if ever, go
to the grocery store to buy one single item. You buy any items you require immediately
in addition to items you will most likely use in the future. The grocery
store is similar to main memory, and your home is the cache. As another example,
consider how many of us carry around an entire phone book. Most of us have a
small address book instead. We enter the names and numbers of people we tend
to call more frequently; looking a number up in our address book is much quicker
than finding a phone book, locating the name, and then getting the number. We
tend to have the address book close at hand, whereas the phone book is probably
located in our home, hidden in an end table or bookcase somewhere. The phone
book is something we do not use frequently, so we can afford to store it in a little
more out of the way location. Comparing the size of our address book to the telephone
book, we see that the address book “memory” is much smaller than that of
a telephone book. But the probability is very high that when we make a call, it is
to someone in our address book.
Students doing research offer another commonplace cache example. Suppose
you are writing a paper on quantum computing. Would you go to the library,
check out one book, return home, get the necessary information from that book,
go back to the library, check out another book, return home, and so on? No, you
would go to the library and check out all the books you might need and bring
them all home. The library is analogous to main memory, and your home is,
again, similar to cache.
And as a last example, consider how one of your authors uses her office. Any
materials she does not need (or has not used for a period of more than six months)
get filed away in a large set of filing cabinets. However, frequently used “data”
remain piled on her desk, close at hand, and easy (sometimes) to find. If she
needs something from a file, she more than likely pulls the entire file, not simply
one or two papers from the folder. The entire file is then added to the pile on her
Bill Gates had given a speech in High School about 11 rules/things they did not and will not learn in school. He talked about how feel-good, politically correct teachings created a generation of kids with no concept of reality and how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.

Three significant poems from this period, Shikwah ("The Complaint"), Jawab-e shikwah ("The Answer to the Complaint"), and Khizr-e rah ("Khizr, the Guide"), were published later in 1924 in the Urdu collection Bang-e dara ("The Call of the Bell"). In those works Iqbal gave intense expression to the anguish of Muslim powerlessness. Khizr (Arabic: Khidr), the Qur`anic prophet who asks the most difficult questions, is pictured bringing from God the baffling problems of the early 20th century.</td></tr>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
The 30Kbps limit that Shannon’s Law imposes on analog telephone modems is a
formidable barrier to the promise of a boundless Internet world open to anyone
who can afford a computer. Although long-distance telephone links have been
fast and digital for decades, the local loop wires running from the telephone
switching center to the consumer continue to use hundred-year-old analog technology.
The “last mile” local loop can, in fact, span many miles, making it
extremely expensive to bring the analog telephone service of yesterday into the
digital world of the present.
Fortunately, the physical conductors in telephone wire are thick enough to support
moderate-speed digital traffic for several miles without severe attenuation. Recognizing
this, telecommunications groups have developed technologies to provide
inexpensive digital services for residences and small businesses. Digital Subscriber
Line (DSL) is one such technology that can coexist with plain old telephone service
(POTS) on the same wire pair that carries the digital traffic. At present, most DSL
services are available only to those customers whose premises connect with the central
telephone switching office (CO) using less than 18,000 feet (5460 m) of copper
cable. Of course, this is not the same thing as saying that a customer is within 18,000
feet of the CO, because the route taken by the service cable is rarely a straight line.
Traditional analog telephone service, POTS, terminates local loop service at a
frame, or switching center, at the CO. From the switching center, a dedicated circuit
is established through another switching center, perhaps onto a long-distance
trunk line, or perhaps directly out of the same switching center back into the same
local loop. All of this circuit switching takes place based on the analog characteristics
of the connection.

get filed away in a large set of filing cabinets. However, frequently used “data”
remain piled on her desk, close at hand, and easy (sometimes) to find. If she
